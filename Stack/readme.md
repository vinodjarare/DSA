# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements are added and removed from only one end, known as the top of the stack. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

A stack has two primary operations: push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, and the pop operation removes the top element from the stack. There is also a third operation called peek or top, which returns the top element of the stack without removing it.

Stacks are often used in programming languages and computer systems for various purposes, such as function call stack, expression evaluation, undo-redo operations, and backtracking algorithms. They can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or dynamic arrays, and their efficiency depends on the implementation method and the size of the stack. The time complexity of the push, pop, and peek operations is O(1) in most cases.

## Operations in stack

- push-insert item
- pop-remove item
- peek-check last element
- clear-empty stack
- size-stack length
- isEmpty-check stack is empty
