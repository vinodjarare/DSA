# Linked List

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each of which contains an element of data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail, with the tail node pointing to null or some sentinel value to indicate the end of the list.

Linked lists are often used to implement dynamic data structures, such as stacks, queues, and associative arrays. They are useful because they can be dynamically resized and modified without requiring contiguous memory blocks.

There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the previous and next nodes in the sequence, allowing for more efficient traversal in both directions.

One of the drawbacks of linked lists is that they do not provide constant-time access to individual elements like arrays do. To access a specific element in a linked list, you must traverse the list starting from the head node and following the pointers until you reach the desired node. This traversal can be slow for large lists, but efficient for small ones.

Linked lists have various use cases in computer science and programming. Here are a few examples:

- 1. Implementing stacks and queues: Linked lists can be used to implement these data structures because the addition and removal of elements can be done at the beginning or end of the list, respectively. This makes linked lists a good choice for implementing dynamic data structures.

- 2. Memory management: Linked lists are often used by operating systems for memory management. When a program requests memory, the operating system can use a linked list to keep track of which memory blocks are allocated and which are free. When a block of memory is freed, it can be added back to the linked list for future allocations.

- 3. Music and video playlists: Linked lists can be used to create playlists for music and video files. Each node in the list represents a file, and the next reference points to the next file in the playlist. This allows for dynamic modification of the playlist by adding or removing files at any point in the list.

- 4. Symbol tables: In computer science, a symbol table is a data structure used to associate values with keys. A linked list can be used to implement a symbol table by representing each key-value pair as a node in the list.

Overall, linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used in many different applications where dynamic data storage and modification are required.

# Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a reference to both the next node and the previous node in the sequence. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions, compared to singly linked lists which only allow traversal in one direction.
