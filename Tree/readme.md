# Tree

In computer science, a tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data and can have zero or more child nodes.

A tree has a root node at the top, which is the starting point of the tree. The root node has zero or more child nodes, which in turn can have zero or more child nodes. The nodes that do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.

Some common types of trees include:

- Binary tree - A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, known as the left child and the right child.

- Binary search tree - A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values in its right subtree.

- AVL tree - An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

- B-tree - A B-tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have more than two children and is used to store large amounts of data on disk or other external storage devices.

- Trees are used in various applications such as file systems, computer networks, decision trees, and game trees. They provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them a popular data structure in computer science.
