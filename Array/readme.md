# Array

## What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, where each element is identified by an index or a key. The elements in an array are typically of the same data type, and the size of the array is fixed at the time of declaration.

In a one-dimensional array, the elements are arranged in a linear sequence, and each element is accessed using its index. For example, an array of integers [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] can be accessed using the indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

In a two-dimensional array, the elements are arranged in a grid or matrix, and each element is identified by a pair of indices (row index and column index). For example, a 2D array of integers [[1, 2], [3, 4]] can be accessed using the indices (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).

Arrays are commonly used in programming languages to represent lists, tables, matrices, and other data structures. They are efficient for accessing and manipulating data, especially when the size of the collection is known in advance. However, arrays can be less flexible than other data structures, such as linked lists, when it comes to inserting or deleting elements, as it may require shifting all the subsequent elements.

Array operations refer to the set of actions that can be performed on arrays to manipulate the elements stored in them. Here are some common operations that can be performed on arrays:

- 1. Accessing: An array element can be accessed by its index, which allows you to read or modify the element's value.
- 2. Insertion: You can insert an element into an array by shifting all the elements after the insertion point to the right, thereby creating a space for the new element.
- 3. Deletion: You can delete an element from an array by shifting all the elements after the deletion point to the left, thereby closing the gap left by the deleted element.
- 4. Traversal: You can iterate through all the elements in an array to perform some operation on each element, such as printing or modifying its value.
- 5. Search: You can search for a specific element in an array by iterating through each element and checking if it matches the element you're looking for.
- 6. Sorting: You can sort the elements in an array in ascending or descending order based on some criteria, such as the element's value
- 7. Merging: You can merge two or more arrays into a single array by concatenating them in a specific order.
