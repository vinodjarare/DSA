# Set

In computer science, a set is an abstract data structure that represents a collection of distinct elements. The elements in a set are unordered and unique, meaning that each element can only appear once in the set.

A set can be implemented in various ways, such as using arrays, linked lists, or hash tables. The choice of implementation depends on the specific needs of the application and the performance requirements.

Some common operations on a set include:

- Adding an element to the set
- Removing an element from the set
- Checking if an element is in the set
- Finding the union of two sets (i.e., the set of all elements in either set)
- Finding the intersection of two sets (i.e., the set of all elements in both sets)
- Finding the difference of two sets (i.e., the set of all elements in one set but not the other)
